This post includes note that helps construct an interesting data visulization of the *Palmer Penguins* data set

## Data import

First, we read the data into Python by running:

```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

To check whether it has been successfully imported, just simply print the first 5 rows of the data set.

```python
print(penguins.head())
```

## Data exploratory

Suppose we only want to visualize the distribution in Species by Island, here what I'm going to do:

1. subset the penguins dataset with the columns, Species and Island, only.
2. abbreviate the name of species.
3. count the size of each specie
4. data visualization!

## Coding

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

df = penguins[['Species', 'Island']]
df["Species"] = df["Species"].str.split().str.get(0)
table = df.groupby('Species').count().reset_index()
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (10, 8))
sns.barplot(x = 'Species', y = 'Island', data = table)
ax.set(title = 'Distribution in Species by Island')
```

## Images

We use `plt.savefig()` to save the plot and place it in the **images** directory. Using the following syntax and changing the URL, we can display the result immediately beneath the code block

```
![image-example.png](/the base URL/images/image-example.png)
```
![new-image-example.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/new-image-example.png)
