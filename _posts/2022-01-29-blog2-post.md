This post includes a tutorial of creating a simple webapp named **Message Bank** using Flask. Basically, this app has two features:

1. allowing users to **submit** their names and messages to the bank.
2. allowing users to **view** their messages been stored in the bank.

Note: this web was developed based on the example in the code from [our PIC16B lecture](https://github.com/PIC16B/flask-interactions) on interactions and machine learning.

[Here](https://github.com/leozhang233/flask-interactions) is my GitHub repository containing the code for your app.

The followings are the Packages/Modules required in this post.

```python
from flask import Flask, g, render_template, request
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
```

To run this website and watch for changes, we need to run the following command in the terminal(For **Mac**)/command prompt(For **Windows**).

`$ export FLASK_ENV=development; flask run`

# §1. Enable Submissions

The first functionality of our webapp is to submit a message. To achieve this feature, we need to create a `submit.html` that **extend** `base.html` under the `template` folder with the three elements below:

- A text box for submitting a message.
- A text box for submitting the name of the user.
- A “submit” button.

Here's my submission page with a message, `I just created a webapp!`, and my name, `Yi Zhang`. These are one of the messages that I'm going to submit to the bank:

![submit.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/submit.png)

The code behind this webpage, `submit.html`, is actually quite simple. Just like the following:

![submit-code.jpg]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/submit-code.jpg)


Since we require two input elements for **message** and **handle**, we can write `<input type="text" name="message" id="message">` and `<input type="text" name="handle" id="handle">` for the later extracting purpose. To make sure the information has been submmited, I also write a if-statement to display a message, `Thanks for submitting a message!`, to the user.

Once the user hits the submit botton, a Thank-you message will display just like the following:

![thanks.jpg]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/thanks.jpg)

Next, back to the `__init__.py` file, I also need two functions, `get_message_db()` for creating a database of messages and `insert_message(request)` for inserting messages into the database.

- **get_message_db()**:

1. This function helps check whether there is a database called `message_db` in the `g` attribute of the app. If not exsit, we run `g.message_db = sqlite3.connect("messages_db.sqlite)` in order to connect to that database.
2. Check whether a table called `messages` exists in `message_db`. If not exist, we apply a SQL command, `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`. To help organize information stored in the table nicely, I give the table an `id` column (integer), a `handle` column (text), and a `message` column (text).
3. Return the connection `g.message_db`.

```python
def get_message_db():
    # check whether there is a database called message_db in the 
    # g attribute of the app
    if 'message_db' not in g:
        g.message_db = sqlite3.connect("messages_db.sqlite")

    cursor = g.message_db.cursor()
    # check whether a table called messages exists in message_db,
    # and create it if not
    cmd = \
        """
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (
            id integer,
            handle text,
            message text);
        """
    cursor.execute(cmd)
    # return the connection
    return g.message_db
```

- **insert_message(request)**:

1. This function mainly extract the message and the handle from request. Since we have already have the `submit.html` prepare the two input elements, all we left is to use the `request.form["message" or "handle"]` and then assign the information seperately for later inserting purpose.
2. To insert the information, we can continue to use SQL command that help put an ID number, the handle, and the message into the database. Personally, I want the ID number of each message is unique. To do that, I set the ID number of a message equal to one plus the current number of rows in `message_db`.
3. Lastly, we use `g.message_db.commit()` to help save the information inserted and then close the connection.

```python
def insert_message(request):
    # access the database
    g.message_db = get_message_db()
    cursor = g.message_db.cursor()
    # extract message and handle from request
    message = request.form["message"]
    handle = request.form["handle"]
    
    # ensure that the ID number of each message is unique
    mycursor = cursor.execute('select * from messages;')
    results = mycursor.fetchall()
    id = len(results) + 1
    
    # insert id, message and handle to the database
    cmd = \
        """
        INSERT INTO messages (id, handle, message)
        VALUES ({id}, '{handle}', '{message}')
        """.format(id = id, handle = handle, message = message)

    cursor.execute(cmd)
    # ensure that the row insertion has been saved
    g.message_db.commit()
    # close the connection
    g.message_db.close()
```

Finally, we still need to use the `route()` decorator with two methods, `POST` and `GET`, to tell Flask what URL should trigger our `submit()` function. As can be seen below, when the messages received by the `POST` method, the app will automatically call the `insert_message(request)` and return to the `submit.html` using `render_template()` with `thanks = True` to help pass the condition to set the Thankyou message mentioned above.

```python
@app.route('/submit/', methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def submit():
    if request.method == 'GET':
        return render_template('submit.html')
    else:
        try:
            insert_message(request)
            return render_template('submit.html', thanks = True)
        except:
            return render_template('submit.html', error=True)
```

# §2. Viewing Random Submissions

The second feature in this app is to view a collection of n (by default is 5 or fewer if necessary) messages from the `message_db`.

Mine looked like this:

![view.jpg]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/view.jpg)

The code behind this webpage, `view.html`, is also very simple. Just like the following:

![view-code.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/view-code.png)

From above, to help iterate every messages from the random messages selected, I used `iterrows()` function. I also take advantage of a special type of support looping/indexing of objects (let's say `row` is a tuple of user id, handle, and message. `row[2]` is the message and `row[1]` is the handle.)

Meanwhile, back to the `__init__.py` file, here's how I write the `random_messages()` function to achieve the viewing task using the sql command. The output of this function is a dataframe that contains 5 or fewer rows of everything including user id, handle, and message that have been randomly ordered.

```python
def random_messages(n):
    # access the database
    g.message_db = get_message_db()
    # select 5 random messages or fewer if necessary
    cmd = \
        """
        SELECT * FROM messages
        ORDER BY RANDOM()
        LIMIT {n}
        """.format(n = n)

    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, g.message_db)
    # close the connection
    g.message_db.close()
    return df
```

Similarly, we pass the `ran_messages` dataframe object been assigned using the `random_messages(5)` function to the `view.html` to achieve our final web-viewing.

```python
@app.route('/view/')
def view():
    try:
        ran_messages = random_messages(5)
        return render_template('view.html', ran_messages = ran_messages)
    except:
        return render_template('view.html', error=True)
```

# §3. Customize Your App

To make my app more colorful, I modify Some CSS in the `style.css` file under the `static` folder.

One example is that I make font of the overall html page look cursive and display a background color as **LIGHTER BLUE**, one of the UCLA Samueli Color.

```python
html {
    font-family: Cursive;
    background: #8BB8E8;
    padding: 1rem;
}
```

And here's my main webpage of the app:

![mainpage.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/mainpage.png)
